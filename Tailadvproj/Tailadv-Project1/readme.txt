Welcome to this project. This project is about a front-end, home page of a hospitality website. Moving further inside in this, the development of this
page languaeges used are HTML and CSS. Moreover a link style sheet is also the part of styling this whole webpage. Well this is a basic small 
project built with no framework added just pure css and html knowledge, which make this project a fantastic front-end home page. Assets
and final output page have been provided in this project by our respected teachers and PW team. Friendly design which can be liked by all users
was the main aim of this project and I think somewhat i have achieved the result, through which this project looks very illustrative and attractive.
